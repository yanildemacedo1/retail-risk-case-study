**Author:** Yanilde Macedo  
**Timeline:** March–May 2025  
**Role:** Receiving – Footwear | Fulfillment | Merchandise (Academy Store #116)  
**Tools:** Written documentation, corporate hierarchy mapping, escalation emails

## Overview

A pattern of inconsistent policy enforcement and retaliation was observed at the store level. Escalation was initiated after internal HR failed to provide written clarification or fair resolution.

---

## Key Issues Documented

- Favoritism in task distribution (BOPIS orders, fulfillment scheduling)  
- Denial of accountability for extra duties assigned off the clock  
- Lack of transparency in performance evaluations  
- HR refusing to respond in writing to documented concerns  
- Deflection from store director and HR representative  
- Escalation to higher corporate HR (Steve Malewicz, VP of Compensation)  
- Ongoing follow-ups with no written closure

---

## Actions Taken

- 6 formal emails written between March 26 and May 15  
- Attached supporting documentation and policy-based questions  
- Submitted escalation packet to VP of HR Operations  
- Reached out to Tami Eichenberger (Director, Market HR) after VP rerouted

---

## Outcome (As of May 2025)

- Store leadership has not addressed inconsistencies in writing  
- Corporate HR has not provided timeline or policy clarification  
- Behavior shifts observed following email pressure  
- Associates unaware of escalation process or encouraged to remain silent

## Relevance to Cybersecurity & Compliance

- Identifying and escalating patterns of internal misuse  
- Mapping org structure to determine accountability flow  
- Using written evidence to mitigate gaslighting and undocumented decisions  
- Applying audit thinking and risk models to workplace scenarios
